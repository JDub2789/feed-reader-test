# Feed Reader Testing

## What is this?
This application runs tests on a feed reader. The feed reader has the following functionality:
* displays an array of feeds from around the web
* opens links to external webpages when those links are clicked
* has a menu that appears and disappears when its button is clicked

The purpose of testing is to ensure the application functions as expected. Tests were written to test each piece of functionality.

## How to run the tests
Download the entire folder, which contains source code for the application. Then, open index.html in your favorite web browser.

The feed reader will run and display a list of articles. At the bottom of the page, the tester will run. The test portion will display green, with no errors present, to indicate that all tests were passed and the application functions as expected.
